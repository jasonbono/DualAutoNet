# testing
* demonstrate dualautonet on standard autoencoder for bianary classification
* demonstrate dualautonet on semisupervised DEEP SAD autoencoder for binary classification
    * add label dilution
    * add label flipping
    * add dilution factor in loss func
* demonstrate dualautonet on coefficient method autoencoder for binary classification using data with probabilistic labels


# writing 
* write about how the techniques hold up agains errors in the labels, and specifically against imbalance in errors of the lables
